    <description_text>About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.
About the Interpretability team:
When you see what modern language models are capable of, do you wonder, "How do these things work? How can we trust them?"
The Interpretability team’s mission is to reverse engineer how trained models work, and Interpretability research is one of Anthropic’s core research bets on AI safety. We believe that a mechanistic understanding is the most robust way to make advanced systems safe. 
People mean many different things by "interpretability". We're focused on mechanistic interpretability, which aims to discover how neural network parameters map to meaningful algorithms. Some useful analogies might be to think of us as trying to do "biology" or "neuroscience" of neural networks, or as treating neural networks as binary computer programs we're trying to "reverse engineer".
We aim to create a solid scientific foundation for mechanistically understanding neural networks and making them safe (see our vision post). We have focused on resolving the issue of "superposition" (see Toy Models of Superposition, Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent, and our May 2023 update), which causes the computational units of the models, like neurons and attention heads, to be individually uninterpretable, and on finding ways to decompose models into more interpretable components. Our subsequent work which found millions of features in Claude 3.0 Sonnet, one of our production language models, represents progress in this direction. In our most recent work, we developed methods that allow us to build circuits using features and use these circuits to understand the mechanisms associated with a model's computation and study specific examples of multi-hop reasoning, planning, and chain-of-thought faithfulness on Claude Haiku 3.5, one of our production models.” This is a stepping stone towards our overall goal of mechanistically understanding neural networks.
A few places to learn more about our work and team are this introduction to Interpretability from our research lead, Chris Olah, Stanford CS25 lecture given by Josh Batson, and TWIML AI podcast with Emmanuel Ameisen.
Some of our team's notable publications include and our Circuits’ Methods and Biology papers, Scaling Monosemanticity: Extracting Interpretable Features from Claude 3 Sonnet, Towards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models With Dictionary Learning, A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits, In-context Learning and Induction Heads, and Toy Models of Superposition. This work builds on ideas from members' work prior to Anthropic such as the original circuits thread, Multimodal Neurons, Activation Atlases, and Building Blocks.
About the role:
As a manager on the Interpretability team, you'll support a team of expert researchers and engineers who are trying to understand at a deep, mechanistic level, how modern large language models work internally. 
Few things can accelerate this work more than great managers. Your work as manager will be critical in making sure that our fast-growing team is able to meet its ambitious safety research goals over the coming years. In this role, you will partner closely with an individual contributor research lead to drive the team's success, translating cutting-edge research ideas into tangible goals and overseeing their execution. You will manage team execution, careers and performance, facilitate relationships within and across teams, and drive the hiring pipeline. 
If you're more interested in making individual direct technical contributions to our research as the primary focus of your role, feel free to apply to our Research Scientist or Research Engineer roles instead.
Responsibilities:
Partner with a research lead on direction, project planning and execution, hiring, and people development
Set and maintain a high bar for execution speed and quality, including identifying improvements to processes that help the team operate effectively 
Coach and support team members to have more impact and develop in their careers
Drive the team's recruiting efforts, including hiring planning, process improvements, and sourcing and closing
Help identify and support opportunities for collaboration with other teams across Anthropic
Communicate team updates and results to other teams and leadership
Maintain a deep understanding of the team's technical work and its implications for AI safety
You may be a good fit if you:
Are an experienced manager (minimum 2-5 years) with a track record of effectively leading highly technical research and/or engineering teams 
Have a background in machine learning, AI, or a related technical field
Actively enjoy people management and are experienced with coaching and mentorship, performance evaluation, career development, and hiring for technical roles
Have strong project management skills, including prioritization and cross-functional coordination and collaboration
Have managed technical teams through periods of ambiguity and change
Are a quick learner, capable of understanding and contributing to discussions on complex technical topics and are motivated to learn about our research
Are a strong communicator both in speaking and in writing
Believe that advanced AI systems could have a transformative effect on the world, and are passionate about helping make sure that transformation goes well
Strong candidates may also have:
Experience scaling engineering infrastructure
Experience working on open-ended, exploratory research agendas aimed at foundational insights
Some familiarity with our work and mechanistic interpretability
Role Specific Location Policy:
This role is expected to be in our SF office for 3 days a week.
The expected salary range for this position is:
Annual Salary:
$340,000—$425,000 USD
Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.
Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.
We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.
How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.
The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.</description_text>

    <description_text>Magic’s mission is to build safe AGI that accelerates humanity’s progress on the world’s most important problems. We believe the most promising path to safe AGI lies in automating research and code generation to improve models and solve alignment more reliably than humans can alone. Our approach combines frontier-scale pre-training, domain-specific RL, ultra-long context, and inference-time compute to achieve this goal.
About the role:
The IT Systems Engineer will keep Magic’s internal tech running and secure. You’ll manage the apps, laptops, and networks everyone relies on, from first-day setup to last-day off-boarding. Your work blends hands-on security with clear, repeatable processes so our people can move fast and our systems stay safe as the company grows.
What you might work on:
Build a secure, automated onboarding/off‑boarding pipeline (IdP, MDM, SSO, hardware logistics)
Build automation that eliminates manual processes and encourages self-service
Stand up and operate our internal helpdesk—policies, playbooks, metrics, and tooling
Design office and home networks: Ubiquiti switches/APs, VPN gateways, Wi‑Fi 7 roll‑outs
Implement endpoint‑protection, patch‑management, and asset‑tracking across macOS &amp; Linux fleets
Own incident response for corporate IT outages; run blameless post‑mortems and drive permanent fixes
Partner with Security to enforce least‑privilege access, and compliance requirements
What we’re looking for:
6 + years in corporate IT, SRE, or support‑engineering roles in complex environments
Track record of building self‑service tooling and knowledge bases that scale you out of the loop.
Deep macOS/Linux administration skills plus scripting ability (Python, Go, or Bash).
Proven experience rolling out identity providers (Okta, Google Workspace), MDM (Kandji, Jamf, Intune), and VPN/ZTNA solutions.
Balances technical opinions and avoiding overbuilding
Writes documentation and communicates technical concepts clearly to all employees
Calm under pressure: you’ve led Sev‑1 corporate IT incidents and communicated crisply with execs.
Bonus: exposure to GPU labs, on‑prem racks, or developer‑first environments heavy on Linux containers.
Magic strives to be the place where high-potential individuals can do their best work. We value quick learning and grit just as much as skill and experience.
Our culture:
Integrity. Words and actions should be aligned
Hands-on. At Magic, everyone is building
Teamwork. We move as one team, not N individuals
Focus. Safely deploy AGI. Everything else is noise
Quality. Magic should feel like magic
Compensation, benefits and perks (US):
Annual salary range: $150K - $225K
Equity is a significant part of total compensation, in addition to salary
401(k) plan with 6% salary matching
Generous health, dental and vision insurance for you and your dependents
Unlimited paid time off
Visa sponsorship and relocation stipend to bring you to SF, if possible
A small, fast-paced, highly focused team</description_text>

Product Managers ensure that products are fulfilling their primary purpose to enable users to perform tasks that create value for the company. Product managers have two broad areas of responsibility:​ 
Setting strategic vision for the product to ensure the customer and their needs are at the center; and ensuring team priorities are supporting business outcomes for customer, product, technical and enabling teams. This requires continual alignment of the product strategy and objectives with customer, product, technical, and enabling teams​ and managing the product backlog, which prioritizes the work of the assigned squads, to achieve the vision and aligned strategy.​ 
To successfully manage these areas of responsibility, product managers must have a deep understanding of the product domain, related technology, and architecture.​ Enterprise Product Managers drive strategy and execution for a complex ecosystem of digital products that cross multiple workflows, technical platforms, and business units. 
YOUR TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
The primary responsibilities of this role, Enterprise Product Manager are to: 
Product Management​ 
The product manager is accountable for the overall success of a product throughout its lifecycle, from conception to decommissioning. They identify domain needs, develop, and validate product concepts, and build a business case. They oversee the product's build and launch, including any sourced services; as well as ensure product availability, stability, and compliance needs are met. Product managers collaborate with various teams, including product development, marketing, finance, legal, manufacturing, operations, and sales, as needed, to ensure cohesive progress and success.​ 
Product Managers drive agile best practices with the team to improve delivery, including continuous planning ahead of each development cycle (e.g. sprint planning) and working together to co-create user stories aligned with the product backlog prioritization. In addition to guiding the team product managers have duties like market opportunity identification, competitive analysis, sales enablement, or monitoring domain performance.​ 
Stakeholder Engagement​ 
It is vital for the product manager to identify their key stakeholder group. Though many strong and loud opinions will be expressed, an effective product manager uses discretion to deliver their product in a way that meets the needs of users and stakeholders who will ensure value is realized for Bayer. Stakeholders should trust that the product manager not only understands their needs but will actively work to ensure their needs are met while delivering the product. ​ 
Product Strategy​ 
The product manager must provide strategic leadership with full end-to-end ownership for their assigned products throughout the entire product lifecycle. They are responsible for planning and optimizing capabilities to deliver business outcomes in the most efficient way. Product managers require strong strategic planning, decision making, and influencing skills to balance the needs of users and various stakeholders.​ 
Product Discovery &amp; Delivery​ 
The product manager is responsible for creating comprehensive product roadmaps, to clarify user needs and non-functional requirements. They provide product oversight by tracking and reporting progress against 90-day outcomes and overall product health (including budget responsibilities). They also plan and manage product delivery while streamlining the corresponding backlog. Product managers are responsible for monitoring user feedback and metrics to co-create solutions that drive a better user experience and deliver more business value. They leverage Design Thinking methodology starting with user needs to prioritize problems and through discovery they perform usability, feasibility, business fit and value testing to determine the optimal solution.​ 
People &amp; Collaboration​ 
Product managers must proactively communicate and collaborate with product users and stakeholders, which requires strong strategic communication skills. Effective cross-functional collaboration is critical for product managers, bringing together diverse skills and knowledge to deliver a valuable product. It's important to maintain strong and productive working relationships with colleagues in product management, engineering, and other technically focused organizations. Product managers are also responsible for mentoring more junior product managers to improve product management and agile practices across the community.

    <description_text>About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.
About the role
We are looking for a Technical Revenue Accounting professional to join our Accounting Team. In this role, you will execute technical accounting evaluation for deal structuring, support revenue accounting operations, and contribute to process and system improvement initiatives. You will work cross-functionally across the organization and solve complex problems on a regular basis! If you are looking for an opportunity to make a significant impact on the financial infrastructure of an innovative company, come join us in our mission to build cutting-edge, safe AI.
Responsibilities: 
Provide technical accounting expertise, partnering with Legal, GTM Finance, and Sales teams on revenue accounting guidance throughout the deal lifecycle
Review revenue contracts and prepare checklists, month-end JEs, and technical accounting memos under manager’s guidance to ensure revenue recognition compliance under ASC 606
Act as a preparer for revenue-related month end close activities and flux analysis
Maintain and follow revenue recognition policies and procedures
Conduct technical research on complex accounting matters and present findings, including for new product launches and GTM strategies
Build and maintain relationships with cross-functional stakeholders to drive effective collaboration
Educate business partners to understand revenue implications in clear, accessible terms 
Participate in and contribute to process improvement and system implementation projects
You may be a good fit if you:
Have 5+ years of progressive accounting experience, with significant focus on revenue recognition
Have strong knowledge of ASC 606 with experience in deal structuring and contract review
Have experience preparing technical accounting memos and revenue recognition policies
Have hands-on experience with revenue recognition tools (e.g., NetSuite ARM, Workday Financial Management, Zuora RevPro)
Possess strong communication skills and ability to influence diverse stakeholders 
Have proven project management skills with ability to drive results 
Have a demonstrated ability to thrive in fast-paced, ambiguous environments
Take a proactive approach to identifying process improvements
Strong candidates may have:
A Bachelor's degree in Accounting or Finance; CPA preferred
Experience with deal desk or similar advisory work
Experience working with consumption-based and subscription-based revenue models
Experience with B2B and B2C revenue streams and accounting operations
The expected salary range for this position is:
Annual Salary:
$160,000—$190,000 USD
Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.
Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.
We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.
How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.
The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.</description_text>

    <description_text>About
Compute is a commodity. We think people should buy it like one.
Startups shouldn’t be forced to buy a year’s worth of compute time in order to get market rate and compute providers shouldn’t go bankrupt because they can’t fully book their clusters.
At SF Compute, our goal is to solve this issue the same way this was solved for every other commodity — by building a venue where compute contracts are traded in real-time and by bringing a new kind of participant into the supply chain, traders.
If we succeed, buyers will be able to get a good price for any order, whether it’s 32 H100s for a month or 8,000 H100s for an hour, and sellers will instantly book out their clusters because traders will speculatively buy them, for a spread. Every FLOP will flow through us somewhere in the supply chain. What Brent is for oil, we will be for compute.
About the Role
ML training clusters are some of the most high performance computers on the planet. Even relatively small clusters would have been in the TOP500 5 years ago. Our supercomputing team is responsible for keeping our compute clusters running smoothly, monitoring hardware health, participating in on-call rotation, and fixing things when they go wrong. We believe strongly in automation — code is the only reliable way to manage hardware at scale. As we scale, this will become a more data-driven role, predicting failures before they happen. We’re a small team, so you’ll be spending time talking to customers as well.
About You
You’ve managed at least one GPU training cluster in the past (ideally a cluster with >1k GPU’s but not required)
You deeply understand Linux, networking fundamentals, CUDA, NCCL, and Infiniband
You enjoy automating hardware deployments, leveraging IaC wherever possible
You appreciate and value good documentation
Some Nice to Haves
Experience with Rust (our bare metal tooling is written in Rust)
Experience with Linux virtualization (KVM, QEMU, libvirt, etc.)
Experience with Kubernetes implementation including CRD’s and CNI’s
Experience with HPC network architectures (eBGP, fat-tree, VXLAN, MCLAG, etc.)
Compensation
US: $170k - $300k + equity
Benefits
Generous equity grant
Team members are offered a competitive salary along with equity in the company
Visa Sponsorships
Yes, we sponsor visas and work permits
Retirement matching
We match 401(k) plans up to 4%
Medical, dental &amp; vision
We offer competitive medical, dental, vision insurance for employees and dependents and cover 100% of premiums
Time off
We offer unlimited paid time off as well as 10+ observed holidays
Parental leave
We offer biological, adoptive, and foster parents paid time off to spend quality time with family
Daily lunch
We cover lunch daily for employees
Unlimited office book budget
You can buy as many books for the office as you want

    <description_text>About Cartesia
Our mission is to build the next generation of AI: ubiquitous, interactive intelligence that runs wherever you are. Today, not even the best models can continuously process and reason over a year-long stream of audio, video and text—1B text tokens, 10B audio tokens and 1T video tokens—let alone do this on-device.
We're pioneering the model architectures that will make this possible. Our founding team met as PhDs at the Stanford AI Lab, where we invented State Space Models or SSMs, a new primitive for training large-scale foundation models. Our team combines deep expertise in model innovation and systems engineering paired with a design-minded product engineering team to build and ship cutting edge models and experiences.
We're funded by leading investors at Index Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners, along with Factory, Conviction, A Star, General Catalyst, SV Angel, Databricks and others. We're fortunate to have the support of many amazing advisors, and 90+ angels across many industries, including the world's foremost experts in AI.
Role responsibilities
We're looking for former Founders, Co-Founders and CTOs to join the team to lead on Special Projects within the company. This role will work directly with our CEO and existing Founders and will collaborate closely with every team within Cartesia. In this role, you'll:
Work on true 0-1 GTM initiatives
Partner with our customers to understand how they’re interacting with our models and sharing any actionable insights and feedback with our engineering teams
Building and scaling new products quickly - if you enjoy shipping, this is the role for you!
You'll have significant autonomy to shape our products and directly impact how cutting-edge AI is applied across various devices and applications.
What we’re looking for:
Founded, co-founded or led technical teams at a startup
Good understanding of both technical and business problems within early stage companies
Have led 0-1 initiatives and can demonstrate clear impact in shipping products
A commercial mindset and ability to partner with GTM teams
Even if you don’t meet every requirement above, we'd encourage you to apply.
Our culture
 We’re an in-person team based out of San Francisco. We love being in the office, hanging out together and learning from each other everyday.
 We ship fast. All of our work is novel and cutting edge, and execution speed is paramount. We have a high bar, and we don’t sacrifice quality and design along the way.
 We support each other. We have an open and inclusive culture that’s focused on giving everyone the resources they need to succeed.
Our perks
 Lunch, dinner and snacks at the office.
 Fully covered medical, dental, and vision insurance for employees.
 401(k).
✈ Relocation and immigration support.
 Your own personal Yoshi.</description_text>

    <description_text>About Atomic Semi
Atomic Semi is building a small, fast semiconductor fab.
It’s already possible to build this with today’s technology and a few simplifications. We’ll build the tools ourselves so we can quickly iterate and improve.
We’re building a small team of exceptional, hands-on engineers to make this happen. Mechanical, electrical, hardware, computer, and process. We’ll own the stack from atoms to architecture. Our team is optimistic about the future and we want to continue pushing the limits of technology.
Smaller is better. Faster is better. Building it ourselves is better.
We believe our team and lab can build anything. We’ve set up 3D printers, a wide array of microscopes, e-beam writers, general fabrication equipment - and whatever is missing, we’ll just invent along the way.
Atomic was founded by Sam Zeloof and Jim Keller. Sam is best known for making chips in his garage, and Jim has been a leader in the semiconductor industry for the past 40 years.
