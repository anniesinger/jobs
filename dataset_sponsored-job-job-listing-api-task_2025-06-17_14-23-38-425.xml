    <description_text>About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.
About the role
We are looking for a Technical Revenue Accounting professional to join our Accounting Team. In this role, you will execute technical accounting evaluation for deal structuring, support revenue accounting operations, and contribute to process and system improvement initiatives. You will work cross-functionally across the organization and solve complex problems on a regular basis! If you are looking for an opportunity to make a significant impact on the financial infrastructure of an innovative company, come join us in our mission to build cutting-edge, safe AI.
Responsibilities: 
Provide technical accounting expertise, partnering with Legal, GTM Finance, and Sales teams on revenue accounting guidance throughout the deal lifecycle
Review revenue contracts and prepare checklists, month-end JEs, and technical accounting memos under manager’s guidance to ensure revenue recognition compliance under ASC 606
Act as a preparer for revenue-related month end close activities and flux analysis
Maintain and follow revenue recognition policies and procedures
Conduct technical research on complex accounting matters and present findings, including for new product launches and GTM strategies
Build and maintain relationships with cross-functional stakeholders to drive effective collaboration
Educate business partners to understand revenue implications in clear, accessible terms 
Participate in and contribute to process improvement and system implementation projects
You may be a good fit if you:
Have 5+ years of progressive accounting experience, with significant focus on revenue recognition
Have strong knowledge of ASC 606 with experience in deal structuring and contract review
Have experience preparing technical accounting memos and revenue recognition policies
Have hands-on experience with revenue recognition tools (e.g., NetSuite ARM, Workday Financial Management, Zuora RevPro)
Possess strong communication skills and ability to influence diverse stakeholders 
Have proven project management skills with ability to drive results 
Have a demonstrated ability to thrive in fast-paced, ambiguous environments
Take a proactive approach to identifying process improvements
Strong candidates may have:
A Bachelor's degree in Accounting or Finance; CPA preferred
Experience with deal desk or similar advisory work
Experience working with consumption-based and subscription-based revenue models
Experience with B2B and B2C revenue streams and accounting operations
The expected salary range for this position is:
Annual Salary:
$160,000—$190,000 USD
Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.
Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.
We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.
How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.
The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.</description_text>
